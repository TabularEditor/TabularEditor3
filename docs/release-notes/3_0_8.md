*If you haven't used Tabular Editor 3 before, you are eligible to a 30 day trial, which can be requested after installation. You can also [purchase a license](https://tabulareditor.com/#licensing).*

**NOTE:** If you previously installed one of the BETA builds, you will have to manually uninstall that before installing this new version.

## Known issues

- Table Import Wizard didn't make it to this release due to some high-priority bugs that had to be fixed. It will be available ASAP! As a work around, simply create a new table and specify the partition query (SQL or M). Then, right-click the table and choose "Update Table Schema..." to import columns.
- See [roadmap](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/12) for more information.

## Improvements in 3.0.8

- Added option for executing only selected EVALUATE statements in DAX queries (shortcut Shift+F5), see issue [#47](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/47).
- Allow using shortcut Ctrl+/ to comment/uncomment code, see issue [#46](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/46). You can also change the comment style (-- or //) under Tools > Preferences > DAX Editor > General.
- DAX Script will now also script measure KPIs, calculated columns and calculated tables in the current selection. We also add comments to make the code more readable (this can be disabled under Tools > Preferences > DAX Scripting).
- There is now an option to automatically add a line break character at the beginning of all DAX expressions, when working against a Power BI model. This makes the code look better in the Power BI Desktop formula bar. This can be disabled under Tools > Preferences >, see issue [#26](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/26).
- When adding Windows AD Role Members, the Directory Object Picker dialog now appears, see issue [#152](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/152).
- The "Add Deployment Metadata" option is now available under Tools > Preferences > Model Deployment.
- Pivot Grid improvements:
  - You can now drag TOM Explorer objects into all areas of the Pivot Grid, see [#49](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/49).
  - Added TOM Explorer context menu option for adding measures, columns and hierarchies directly to a Pivot Grid.
  - Added "Show field" button in Pivot Grid, to display all available fields on the connected database.
  - Added a "Go to object" right-click menu option in the Pivot Grid.
- Relationship errors (ambiguous paths, invalid state, etc.) are now detected and indicated in the TOM Explorer
