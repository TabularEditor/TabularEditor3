**NOTE:** If you previously installed one of the BETA builds, you will have to manually uninstall that before installing this new version.

## Known issues

- Table Import Wizard didn't make it to this release due to some high-priority bugs that had to be fixed. It will be available ASAP! As a work around, simply create a new table and specify the partition query (SQL or M). Then, right-click the table and choose "Update Table Schema..." to import columns.
- See [roadmap](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/12) for more information.

## Improvements in 3.0.10

- Updated AMO/TOM to version [19.22.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.retail.amd64/).
- Allow incremental search in "Select Item" dialogs, such as when adding tables to a diagram,see issue [#167](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/167).

## Bugfixes in 3.0.10

- Fixed an issue with TOM Explorer losing current selection when trying to drag an object into a text editor
- Fixed an issue with the semantic analyzer causing false "A single value for column ... cannot be determined" errors, when a DAX expression somewhere in the model used ALLEXCEPT, see [#140](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/140).
- Macro recorder now works for calculation item expressions, format string expressions, measure detail rows expressions, and more, see [#143](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/143).
- Added the `Model.AddCalculationGroupTable(<name>)` method for C# script purposes. This also fixes issue [#144](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/144).
- DAX Script should no longer add extra indentation, see [#165](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/165).
