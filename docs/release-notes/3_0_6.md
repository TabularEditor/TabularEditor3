*If you haven't used Tabular Editor 3 before, you are eligible to a 30 day trial, which can be requested after installation. You can also [purchase a license](https://tabulareditor.com/#licensing).*

**NOTE:** If you previously installed one of the BETA builds, you will have to manually uninstall that before installing this new version.

## Known issues

- Table Import Wizard didn't make it to this release due to some high-priority bugs that had to be fixed. It will be available ASAP! As a work around, simply create a new table and specify the partition query (SQL or M). Then, right-click the table and choose "Update Table Schema..." to import columns.
- See [roadmap](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/12) for more information.

## Improvements in 3.0.6:

- Support for consultancy licenses. [More details](https://tabulareditor.com/consultancy-edition/).
- DAX queries now display row counts and timings (see issue [#10](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/10))
- DAX queries are now limited to 1000 rows by default, to prevent timeouts/memory issues. This limit can be changed in Tools > Preferences > Data Browsing > DAX Query.
- Columns in the DAX query results can now be sorted and filtered (local sorting/filtering only). See issue [#60](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/60)
- Data from grids (DAX query results, Table Preview, etc.) can now be copied to the clipboard
- When copying a DAX expression the syntax highlighting is now preserved on the clipboard. See issue [#80](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/80).
- When adding a calculated table through a C# script expression, the semantic analyzer now immediately adds the calculated table columns to the table based on the DAX expression (instead of after script execution).
- Updated TOM client library to v. 19.22.0.1
- Portable versions (.zip) now available. Remember that you have to [manually register Tabular Editor 3 with Power BI Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-external-tools#registering-external-tools) if using the portable version.

## Bugfixes in 3.0.6:

- Can now use the `EvaluateDax`, `ExecuteCommand`, `SelectTable`, `SelectMeasure` etc. methods in C# scripts (similar to Tabular Editor 2.x), see [#44](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/44).
- The `CustomAction` C# script method now works properly, see [#79](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/79).
- Better reestablishing of connections to AS (should see fewer "connection lost" crashes)
- Best Practice Analyzer can now be instantiated through a C# script: `new TabularEditor.Shared.BPA.Analyzer();` - this is different than in Tabular Editor 2.x in which the Analyzer class resided in a different namespace. See issue [#45](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/45)
- Copy operations are now supported when folders are selected, see [#84](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/84)
- Improved filtering of date columns in the Table Preview, see [#77](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/77)
- Fixed a bug where semantic engine feature overrides were not in effect, see [#62](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/62).
