**NOTE:** If you previously installed one of the BETA builds, you will have to manually uninstall that before installing this new version.

## Known issues

- Table Import Wizard didn't make it to this release due to some high-priority bugs that had to be fixed. It will be available ASAP! As a work around, simply create a new table and specify the partition query (SQL or M). Then, right-click the table and choose "Update Table Schema..." to import columns.
- See [roadmap](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/12) for more information.
