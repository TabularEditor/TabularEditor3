**NOTE:** If you previously installed one of the BETA builds, you will have to manually uninstall that before installing this new version.

## Known issues

- Table Import Wizard didn't make it to this release due to some high-priority bugs that had to be fixed. It will be available ASAP! As a work around, simply create a new table and specify the partition query (SQL or M). Then, right-click the table and choose "Update Table Schema..." to import columns.
- See [roadmap](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/12) for more information.

## Bugfixes in 3.0.4:

- Refreshing the Best Practice Analyzer no longer causes a crash

## New features in 3.0.3:

- Right-clicking on an item in the Processing View now lets you requeue that item or, if the item represents a single table, opens a data preview of that table. â€‹

## Bugfixes in 3.0.3:

- When the semantic analyzer detects an error on a calculated column/calculated table, it no longer modifies the columns on that table (this was previously causing relationships to be dropped in some circumstances)
- Fixed an issue with enabled-state of certain controls on the Find/Replace dialog
- Several bugfixes based on telemetry and error reports, such as:
  - Copy/pasting columns with lineage tags now works
  - Pasting a table over an existing one when the table is renamed no longer causes a crash
  - "Revert" button now reconnects to AS before refresing the local TOM, instead of causing a crash
  - Right-clicking in the property grid while it is empty no longer causes a crash
  - And many, many others...
- Fixed MRUs not being properly saved for the "Server" dropdown
- Fixed several issues with the Workspace Mode not properly loading data source override values from the User Options file. See [#28](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/28).
- Fixed and improved several "phantom" DAX semantic errors (support for ROLLUPADDISSUBTOTAL, COUNTROWS with 0 arguments, etc.)
- Improved autocomplete / calltips for several DAX functions (TOPN, TOPNPERLEVEL, interval parameter for DATEADD/DATESINPERIOD/PARALLELPERIOD), after RETURN keyword, etc.
