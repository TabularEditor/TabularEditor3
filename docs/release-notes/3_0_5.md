## Known issues

- Table Import Wizard didn't make it to this release due to some high-priority bugs that had to be fixed. It will be available ASAP! As a work around, simply create a new table and specify the partition query (SQL or M). Then, right-click the table and choose "Update Table Schema..." to import columns.
- See [roadmap](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/12) for more information.

## Improvements in 3.0.5:

- Diagram view now looks much better (in both light and dark themes), and relationship routes are updated while tables are dragged around on the canvas.

## Bugfixes in 3.0.5:

- Expression Editor, if hidden, doesn't automatically pop up when selecting a diagram item / TOM explorer item. Instead, double-click on the item in the TOM Explorer or bring it back using the View menu (see issue [#43](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/43).
- DAX parser should no longer report circular dependencies when there are none (see issue [#63](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/63) and [#64](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/64))
- Fixed an issue with DAX parser determination of SourceColumn values on CalculatedTableColumns, which could cause columns to be deleted (and by extension, relationships) upon model load.
- DAX parser now shows an error if certain keywords are used as DAX variables (which is not allowed). See issue [#58](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/58).
- Hitting ':' when starting a search, now immediately switches to "Entire Model" and Dynamic LINQ mode.
- Dynamic LINQ now also search partitions and calculation group items, see issue [#70](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/70).
