## Known issues

- Table Import Wizard didn't make it to this release. It will be available in 3.0.2 which is coming out very soon. As a work around, simply create a new table and specify the partition query (SQL or M). Then, right-click the table and choose "Update Table Schema..." to import columns.
- See [roadmap](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/12) for more information.

## New features in 3.0.1:
