      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s
rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH
THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU
ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

   a) General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software.
   
   b) ThirdPartySoftware. The software may include third party applications
      that Microsoft, not thet hird party, licenses to you under this
	  agreement. Any included notices for third party applications are for
	  your information only.
	  
   c) Competitive Benchmarking. If you are a direct competitor, and you
      access or use the software for purposes of competitive benchmarking,
	  analysis, or intelligence gathering, you waive as against Microsoft,
	  its subsidiaries, and its affiliated companies (including prospectively)
	  any competitive use, access, and benchmarking test restrictions in the
	  terms governing your software to the extent your terms of use are, or
	  purport to be, more restrictive than Microsoft’s terms. If you do not
	  waive any such purported restrictions in the terms governing your
	  software, you are not allowed to access or use this software, and will
	  not do so.
	  
2. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. The software may contain code you are permitted to
   distribute (i.e. make available for third parties) in applications you
   develop, as described in this Section.
   
   a) Distribution Rights. The code and test files described below are
      distributable if included with the software.
	  
      i.   REDIST.TXT Files. You may copy and distribute the object code form
	       of code listed on the REDIST list in the software, if any, or listed
		   at Redist.txt;
      ii.  Image Library. You may copy and distribute images, graphics, and 
	       animations in the Image Library as described in the software
		   documentation; and
      iii. Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your
	       applications to copy and distribute any of this distributable code
		   you elect to distribute with your applications.
		   
   b) Distribution Requirements. For any code you distribute, you must:
   
      i.   add significant primary functionality to it in your applications;
      ii.  require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
	       protect it and Microsoft at least as much as this agreement; and
      iii. indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
	       including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of
		   your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based
		   solely on the unmodified distributable code.
		   
   c) Distribution Restrictions. You may not:
          
      i.  use Microsoft’s trademarks or trade dress in your application in any
	      way that suggests your application comes from or is endorsed by Microsoft;
		  or
      ii. modify or distribute the source code of any distributable code so that
	      any part of it becomes subject to any license that requires that the
		  distributable code, any other part of the software, or any of Microsoft’s
		  other intellectual property be disclosed or distributed in source code
		  form, or that others have the right to modify it.
		  
3. DATA COLLECTION. The software may collect information about you and your use of
   the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to
   provide services and improve Microsoft’s products and services. Your opt-out
   rights, if any, are described in the product documentation. Some features in the
   software may enable collection of data from users of your applications that access
   or use the software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your
   applications, you must comply with applicable law, including getting any required
   user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately informs
   users about how you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about
   Microsoft’s data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft
   Privacy Statement at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839. You agree to
   comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.
   
4. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other
   rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you
   will not (and have no right to):
   
   a) work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to 
      use it in certain ways;
   b) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software;
   c) remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in
      the software;
   d) use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate
      malware; or
   e) share, publish, distribute, or lend the software (except for any distributable
      code, subject to the terms above), provide the software as a stand-alone hosted
	  solution for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any
	  third party.
	  
5. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export
   laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on
   destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions,
   visit http://aka.ms/exporting.
   
6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any
   support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all faults”,
   and without warranty of any kind.
   
7. UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install
   them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources.
   Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to
   receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not
   include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.
   
8. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. This Section applies if you live in
   (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States. If
   you and Microsoft have a dispute, you and Microsoft agree to try for 60 days to
   resolve it informally. If you and Microsoft can’t, you and Microsoft agree to binding
   individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association under the Federal
   Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead,
   a neutral arbitrator will decide. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations,
   private attorney- general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a
   representative capacity are not allowed; nor is combining individual proceedings
   without the consent of all parties. The complete Arbitration Agreement contains more
   terms and is at http://aka.ms/arb-agreement-1. You and Microsoft agree to these terms.
   
9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for
   supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the
   software.
   
10. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the
    United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a
	business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation
	of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer
	protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws
	principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If you
	acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA
	governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you
	and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in
	King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration). If
	not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior
	Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding
	arbitration).
	
11. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights.
    You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state,
	province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you
	may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software.
	This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province,
	or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one
	of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions
	apply to you:
	
    a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and
	   nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
    b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by
	   turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the
	   Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will
	   resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The
	   product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your
	   specific device or software.
    c) Germany and Austria.
	   
	   i.  Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as
	       described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However,
		   Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
       ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence,
	       claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or
		   personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory
		   law.
		   
           Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight
		   negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
		   the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
		   breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance
		   with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations").
		   In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
		   negligence.
		   
12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING
    IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT
	PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING
	MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
	
13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES
    DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS
	SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES,
	INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
	
    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content
	including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b)
	claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability,
	negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted
	by applicable law.
	
    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of
	the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state,
	province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental,
	consequential, or other damages.
